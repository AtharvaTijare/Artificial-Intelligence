        "\n",
        "# ### 🔸 **Objective:**\n",
        "\n",
        "# To implement a basic logic-based learning system capable of learning from a set of predefined logical rules and data examples. The system should identify which examples satisfy at least one of the given logical rules and return them as learned facts.\n",

        "# ---\n",
        "\n",
        "# ### 🔸 **Introduction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "# Logic learning systems are foundational in artificial intelligence and knowledge-based systems. They operate on the principle of applying logical rules to data to infer new knowledge. These systems are especially useful in rule-based expert systems, inductive logic programming (ILP), and decision-making frameworks.\n",
        "\n",
        "# ---\n",
        "\n",
        "# ### 🔸 **Concept:**\n",
        "\n",
        "# A **logic learning system** consists of:\n",
        "\n",
        "# * **Rules:** Logical functions or conditions defined by the user (e.g., \"even number\", \"greater than 10\").\n",
        "# * **Examples:** Input data points (numbers, strings, etc.).\n",
        "# * **Learning Mechanism:** A procedure to apply the rules to the examples and determine which examples satisfy the rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "# ---\n",
        "\n",
        "# ### 🔸 **System Design:**\n",
        "\n",
        "# #### 1. **Data Structure:**\n",
        "\n",
        "# * A list to store logical rules (functions that return `True` or `False`).\n",
        "# * A list to store example values (integers, in this case).\n",
        "# * A set to store and return learned facts (examples that match any rule).\n",
        "\n",
        "# #### 2. **Functionality:**\n",
        "\n",
        "# * **add\\_rule(rule):** Adds a logical rule to the system.\n",
        "# * **add\\_example(example):** Adds a data example.\n",
        "# * **learn():** Applies each rule to each example. If any rule is satisfied by an example, that example is added to the list of learned facts.\n",
        "\n",
        "# ---\n",
        "\n",
        "# ### 🔸 **Working Mechanism:**\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. The system is initialized.\n",
        "# 2. Logical rules are defined and added (e.g., \"x is even\", \"x > 10\").\n",
        "# 3. Data examples are input (e.g., 4, 7, 15, 12).\n",
        "# 4. The system iterates through each example and applies the rules.\n",
        "# 5. If an example satisfies **any** rule, it is considered a **learned fact**.\n",
        "# 6. The final result is a set of all such facts.\n",
        "\n",
        "# ---\n",
        "\n",
        "# ### 🔸 **Advantages:**\n",
        "\n",
        "# * Simple and extensible logic framework.\n",
        "# * Easy to adapt to different types of rules and data formats.\n",
        "# * Can be expanded into more complex AI systems (e.g., expert systems, ILP).\n",
        "\n",
        "# ---\n",
        "\n",
        "# ### 🔸 **Applications:**\n",
        "\n",
        "# * Rule-based expert systems.\n",
        "# * Decision support tools.\n",
        "# * Educational tools for teaching logic and AI.\n",
        "# * Knowledge filtering and categorization.\n",
        "\n",
        "# ---\n",
        "\n",
        "# ### 🔸 **Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "# This practical demonstrates the fundamentals of logic learning systems. By combining user-defined logical rules with example data, the system can autonomously infer knowledge in the form of learned facts. This forms a core component of symbolic AI, and provides a basis for more advanced learning systems such as knowledge-based agents or logic programming frameworks.\n",
